        <h2>My experience</h2>
        <p class="bold">As a seasoned professional in the realms of C++ programming and website development, I bring a wealth of
            expertise garnered over 2 years in the field. In my role at ACT, I spearheaded
            impactful projects where my proficiency in C++ shone through. I led the development of a robust C++
            application that optimized data processing, resulting in a substantial 20% improvement in system
            performance. Simultaneously, my role in website development at ACT involved crafting dynamic and
            user-centric web interfaces. Leveraging my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I successfully implemented
            responsive designs and collaborated with cross-functional teams to ensure seamless integration of front-end
            and back-end components. These experiences have not only honed my technical abilities but have also
            instilled in me a keen understanding of the intricate balance between functionality and user experience in
            the digital landscape. I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of innovation in both C++ programming
            and website development, and I am excited about the prospect of contributing my skills to future projects in
            these dynamic domains. </p>
